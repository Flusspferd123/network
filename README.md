## Running the application in dev mode

You can run your application in dev mode that enables live coding using:
```shell script
mvn compile quarkus:dev
```

The application exposes a dev console, available at http://localhost:8080/q/dev-ui/ (dev mode only), and it also hosts a swagger UI located at http://localhost:8080/q/api/documentation (also only active during development).
